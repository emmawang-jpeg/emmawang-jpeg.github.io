      <h1>The Data</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">To start, we decided to focus on some of the most popular multiplayer competitive games</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Some of these titles include, League of Legends, Valorant, CS:GO, Dota 2, Fortnite, PUBG, Rainbow Six, Rocket League, and Overwatch. Research was done to look into how these games supported the queer community and discouraged toxicity and harassment. We also talked to gaymers on their own thoughts for how games can be more welcoming.</p>
        
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Additionally, we posted a survey on various locations on the internet where gaymers may be lurking to better understand their experiences with other singleplayer or roleplay games.</h5>
